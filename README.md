## Maze Solving Algorithms through Stackelberg Model-Based Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains the code for a project that explores the application of model-based reinforcement learning algorithms for maze-solving tasks. The problem is formulated in its Stackelberg form, representing an asymmetric two-player game. Rational actors are identified as a leader and a follower, representing the policy and Markov Decision Process parameters of a reinforcement learning agent. The objective is to learn general rules that enable the discovery of solutions in previously unseen maze environments. The policy agent and the model agent operate in an adversarial dynamic, attempting to determine the Stackelberg equilibrium of the duopoly."
